# Magical Loot

> A Minecraft 1.16.x data pack that adds magical loot to some mobs (who doesn't like magical items?).

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here][latest] and put the zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world.

## Crafting

The items can't be crafted and are dropped by killing mobs. They do have a percentage drop chance and have been added to the mob's drop pool.

## License

The data pack is licensed under the GPLv3. For more information, take a look at the license file within this repository.

## Inspiration

The ideas are taken from [this mod][mod] and applied to Vanilla items.
